<!-- 1. ui-router state:
-defines the controller
-defines a resolve prop that passes data from json to the controller
2. Controller.js
-takes the resolve prop and assigns it to a variable on the controller instance
3. ui-router state html
-uses a custom html tag (defined in a component. makes the html you're going to display there modular)
-the custom tag uses an ng-repeat, placing an item of data from the controller into a variable.
-this variable is then assigned to a custom property (also defined on the component)
4. Component.js
-defines the name of the component and the name of the binding
5. Component html
-here, the binding, seeded with data, is passed to another state in a ui-router sref
-the binding is also used to display data in the html -->
