Title: Blackjack BJ-1

Fluff Text:
This model is based off concept art from the video game Mechwarrior Online, which is further based off a science fiction vehicle From
the BATTLETECH universe.

The Blackjack is a 45 ton, Medium Class, anthropomorphic battlemech. The BJ-1 variant was designed as a long range, direct fire-support platform,
suitable for scrimmages and attack-defense operations involving similarly classed battlemechs and ground vehicles.

The BJ-1 sports two Autocannon 2 ballisitc weapons, one in each arm, as well as 4 Medium Lasers. The canonical variant only has 1 medium laser mounted in
the left and right arm, with the remaining lasers mounted in the left and right side-torsos. My depiction places all the weapons in the arms in accordance
with the game's concept art, however this is apocryphal per BATTLETECH lore.

The BJ-1 also runs a Standard 180 Fusion Engine allowing it to achieve a top speed of 64.8km/h, and each leg mounts 2 jump jets for added mobility

Lastly, the chassis mounts 8.5 tons of standard armor

Height: x in
Width: x in

The model itself features posable arms, as well as torso, which can be rotated 360 degrees and adjusted for elevation.
The legs use adjustable joints, however the hips are locked in place for stability, and as such the legs cannot be posed.

The model also houses a mini-fig pilot!
