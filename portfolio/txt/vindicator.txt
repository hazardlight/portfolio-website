Title: Vindicator 1R

Fluff:
This model is an adaptation of a vehicle from the BATTLETECH universe, based off fan art and pewter miniatures.

The Vindicator is a 45 Ton, anthropomorphic battlemech designed for long range scrimmaging. To facilitate this, the 1R variant sports a combination of 2
long range weapon systems: a single PPC (particle projector cannon) in the right arm, and a left torso mounted long range missile 5 unit.
For short range backup, the 1R also mounts a Medium laster in the head, and a Small Laser in the left arm.

While not the fastest battlemech in its weight class, the Vindicator runs a Standard Engine 180, allowing it to achieve a top speed of 64.8 km/h. It also
4 jump jets for added maneuverability over hills and rough terrain.

The model was designed entirely in a CAD program (LDraw) without physical prototyping. Building models in LDraw is particularly advantageous because
there is no limit on what parts you have available to make your model, however there is an intuitive aspect to building with physical bricks that gives
me a better sense of what designs ideas will work better than others, especially when constructing surfaces via SNOT (studs not on top), or trying
to build leg and arm joints at unusual angles.

The model features posable arms and a posable torso, adjustable for rotation. The head also contains a mini-fig pilot!
