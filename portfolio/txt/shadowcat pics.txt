Title
Shadow Cat Prime

Fluff Text:
This model is a custom rendition of a vehicle from the BATTLETECH universe, and was based off a variety of concept art and pewter miniatures.

The Shadowcat is a Medium Class OmniMech designed by the faction Clan Nova Cat. It is a 45 ton, non-anthropomorphic vehicle suited for raiding and and scouting
missions. The OmniMech designation means that the vehicle is capable of modular customization, where arms, legs, and side-torsos can be quickly swapped out
for alternative weapon and equipment configurations.

The Prime variant mounts 2 Extended Range Medium lasers in the left arm and a Gauss Rifle in the right, making it particularly dangerous at
longer ranges against similarly classed vehicles. This variant also houses an Active Probe sensor unit, capable of detecting units hidden by
means of electromagnetic countermeasures.

The chassis sports an Extra Light Engine 280 allowing it to travel 97km/h, as well as 6 jump jets, and a MASC unit for a temporary boost of speed
up to 130km/h. The MASC unit is effectively a turbo module that boosts power to the leg actuators at the cost of added heat, and potential damage if
used at top speeds for long periods of time.

Model Dimensions:
height: x in
width: x in

The Shadow Cat was the first model I had completed with the intent of combining a coherent color scheme with a detailed external finish. The model
itself features posable arms and torso, however the torso does not features adjustable elevation, and can only rotate about its axis.
The legs are also fixed in place to ensure stability.

To reflect the OmniMech capability from the lore, all the major components are held together via pins and studs for easy disassembly.

As with the rest of my vehicle models, this one features a mini-fig pilot in the cockpit!
