Title: Shadowhawk-2H

Fluff Text:

This model was inspired by Mechwarrior Online's concept art for the same vehicle from the BATTLETECH universe.

The Shadowhwak is a 55 ton, Medium Class, anthropomorphic battlemech designed as an all range scrimmager, raider, and brawler.
The 2H variant sports one autocannon 5 mounted in the left shoulder, a Medium laser mounted in the right arm,
a Long Range Missile-5 unit mounted in the right torso, and a head mounted Short Range Missile-2 unit. The menagerie of different weapon systems
allows the 2H to participate in different roles, however because of it's lack of dedicated load-out, it does not necessarily fair well on its own, and
is best used paired with other units for assistance. Additionally, the chassis uses anthropomorphic arms that can be used for close range attacks,
as well as limited equipment transportation.

The 2H runs a Standard Engine 275 allowing it to travel 86.4km/h, and mounts 3 jump jets across the left, right, and center torsos. The jump jets allow
the Shadowhawk greater easy of motion when changing elevation, especially when traveling along rough terrain.

The architecture for my model is designed using a building technique called SNOT, meaning Studs Not On Top. This is used to create all the sloped
geometry on the front of the model's torso, as well as to attach the head. The most challenging part of the build was to design the core structure
in such a way that external components would lock in place at their correct angles, while also making the overall model robust enough to handle and
manipulate without breaking easily.

My model features posable arms and a posable torso that can be adjusted for rotation and elevation. The legs are built from posable components, but are
fixed in place for stability.

And yes, there is a mini-fig pilot there as well!
